# Fractals
Welcome to the amazing world of fractals !
A fractal is a curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. 
They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales,
and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.
This project is a collection of such interesting fractals, with diverse designs and approaches. 
The project is made on Javascript using the very powerful P5.Js framework.
